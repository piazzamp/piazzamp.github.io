I do computer stuff during the day, otherwise I tweet about backpacks and I email about movies.
If you want in on my movies & tv email thread (it's very casual) just ask. If you want
in on the backpack tweets you're gonna have to endure the rest of my tweets â€“ they're 
mostly about how easy it is to destroy your local copy of a git repo or how dumb
tech culture tends to be. I live in Chicago but I spent 5 years in Charleston, SC.
