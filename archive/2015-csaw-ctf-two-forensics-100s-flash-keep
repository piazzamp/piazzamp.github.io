	<p>these two forensics challenges were especially easy – perhaps I just found skiddie workarounds or something. but, points-wise, they were on the same level as notesy so their ease makes some sense :)</p>

<h2>keep calm and ctf</h2>

<p>the challenge presented us with <a href="https://ctf.isis.poly.edu/static/uploads/82341a6c6f03e3af261a95ba81050c0a/img.jpg">an image</a> and told us it was special. steganography was likely a force at play.

<p>above is the way I actually solved this one (with david). highlighted, you can see the flag. this solution was inspired by the photo of <a href="http://fuzyll.com/csaw2015/yoshi">yoshi</a> in fuzyll&rsquo;s recon challenge. both of these images contained stegonagraphic data inside of an image. for yoshi, I tried to view the source to look for html comments or some other easy hint like that, but instead I saw this steganographic stuff. nice nice.
an easier (and more <code>1337</code> way to find this) is to combine <code>xxd</code> and <code>vim</code> into a mythical hexeditor. thanks to my coworker, <a href="http://kingsalemno.com/aboutking">king</a>, for showing me this recently.
basically, open img.jpg with <code>vim</code> and type <code>:%!xxd</code> which, if I am interpreting it correctly, runs <code>xxd</code> on the file (aka <code>%</code>) and writes the results back into the buffer. see below.

then just slam <code>:q!</code> to exit without saving the hexdump. or you could, ya'know, just hexdump outside of <code>vim</code>.</p>

<h2>flash</h2>

<p>the challenge statment for this one was: <code>We were able to grab an image of a harddrive. Find out what's on it.</code> tough. I downloaded the file and ran <code>strings</code> on it to see if there was anything especially juicy. the last printable string in the image turned out to be the flag:

that&rsquo;s it. welcome to ctfs. flags just sort of plop out of files like that sometimes.</p>
