	<p>all of the 50-point crypto challenges this year were based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot_(TV_series)">Mr Robot</a> episodes – the ciphertext files were named after episodes while all the flags were quotes from that episode. neat.</p>

<h3>eps1.1_ones-and-zer0es_c4368e65e1883044f3917485ec928173.mpeg</h3>

<p>we were given the following ciphertext:

<p>obviously this is supposed to represent some binary data. I googled &rsquo;<a href="http://www.binaryhexconverter.com/binary-to-ascii-text-converter">binary to ascii</a>&rsquo; and pasted in the string. which is kind of funny since it&rsquo;s ascii to ascii, really (or, like, ascii to unicode or something). episode 1.1, easy as pie.</p>

<h3>eps1.7_wh1ter0se_2b007cf0ba9881d954e85eb475d0d5e4.m4v</h3>

<p>this time we were given ciphertext that looked to be produced by a standard rotation or substitution cipher
<code>EOY XF, AY VMU M UKFNY TOY YF UFWHYKAXZ EAZZHN. UFWHYKAXZ ZNMXPHN. UFWHYKAXZ EHMOYACOI. VH'JH EHHX CFTOUHP FX VKMY'U AX CNFXY FC OU. EOY VH KMJHX'Y EHHX IFFQAXZ MY VKMY'U MEFJH OU.</code>
me, elaina, sarah, and callum swarmed to the file for some quick frequency analysis. such a short piece of ciphertext could only get us so far. sarah had taken some sort of cryptology course in estonia so she told us to examine the frequencies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">n-grams</a>. that also gave us some strong candidate translations. but what ended up being the key, was to simply look at the ciphertext and figure out how it could fit into the english language. we focused on <code>EOY</code> and <code>TOY</code> – <code>EOY</code> has to be a word that can start a sentence or phrase and its last two letters must make sense as the last two letters of another 3-letter word. the same tactic was applied to <code>XF</code> (word 2) and <code>YF</code> (word 8). we attempted to uncover the substitution alphabet one or two characters at a time, then translate the ciphertext with each character in the candidate substitution alphabet lowercased so that we would be able to more easily see which character we still had to uncover. the apostrophes helped a lot – <code>VH'JH</code> was likely <code>we're</code> or <code>we've</code> and each of the single characters following an apostrophe was likely a <code>t</code>, <code>s</code>, or maybe even a <code>d</code>. after applying some of these assumptions, more patterns became apparent and some partially decrypted words had an obvious plaintext value that lead to the discovery of more of the substitution alphabet. here&rsquo;s a glamour shot of the finale to this solve:</p>

<p>this one was solved by ethan.
if you aren&rsquo;t familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64 encoding</a>, I googled it for you. but essentially, it&rsquo;s a way to encode binary data to printable ascii characters. it&rsquo;s used in http basic authentication. you can put binary data in-line in an html file with this sort of encoding.
immeiately I try <code>base64 -D eps1.9_zer0-day_b7604a922c8feef666a957933751a074.avi</code> only to see <code>Invalid character in input stream.</code> I determined that it was the backslash (<code>\</code>) that was invalid. so I removed them all and everything came out screwey when I went to decode it again. since each character represents 5 bits, incorrectly removing a single character from base64 encoded data will misalign the following bits. anyway, ethan later told us that the <code>\</code> I was removing should have been <code>\n</code> – the standard newline escape sequence. thus: <code>sed 's/\\n//g' eps1.9_zer0-day_b7604a922c8feef666a957933751a074.avi | base64 -D -</code>. a few things are going on in this command. first the <code>sed</code> command contains two backslashes <code>\\</code> to escape a single backslash so that the pattern matches the <code>\n</code> in the input string. then there are two forward slashes <code>//</code> which is normally where we would put the string to replace <code>\n</code> with, but we&rsquo;re just replacing it with nothing. then the <code>-</code> at the very end, this is to represent <code>stdin</code> ie <code>base64</code> will decode whatever comes into <code>stdin</code>.</p>

<p>very cool. 150 points in the bag.</p>

<p>next is a 100-point challenge that unfortunately eschews the Mr Robot theme. the challenge is down now so I missed my opportunity to take a gnarly screen grab (jk it was just a input textbox on a page). anything you put in this textbox would be &lsquo;encrypted&rsquo; by what seemd to be yet another substitution cipher. competitors in the <code>#isislab</code> irc channel were flipping out about this one. I admit to having similar frustrations as them – there seemed to be little direction to the challenge. it was easy to figure out what was going on but not to figure out what the flag should be. later on the CSAW team put up some good hints.

<p>these hints came, word for word, from the irc channel. anyway they lead me to the solution – the substitution alphabet which can simply be recovered by entering in the normal alphabet into the encrytor: <code>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</code> if you&rsquo;re not familiar. once you know how the characters are rearranged you have broken the cryptosystem and can go back-n-forth between plaintext and ciphertext as you please.
ps – the youtube link in hint no. 2 goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68BjP5f0ccE">nic cage teaches the alphabet</a> since you just had to enter the abc&rsquo;s to solve the challenge.</p>
