<p>Here’s a blog post that is not about computers because, as it turns out, I have more than one interest. Who knew? If you follow me on twitter, you may have already picked up on my thing for backpacks. I cannot explain why I like them; I will defend myself, however, by stating outright that I am not an EDC bro and do not have any length of paracord on my keychain - I do have a knife, but it lives near my front door where I cut open my purchases from the world-wide web. One of those purchases was a messenger bag from the bike-heads at Mission Workshop: The Monty - Advanced.</p>

<p>The Monty is a medium-sized (21L) messenger bag with a main compartment and two external pockets that are the size of a small paperback (they fit my kindle with room to spare). It comes in a variety of fabrics at a few different price points. I opted for the “Advanced” HT500 fabric since they say it wears well - like waxed canvas - and I wanted to check out their Arkiv strap buckles. The all-synthetic fabric on my previous bag showed almost no wear after almost two years of continuous use and I’d had enough.</p>

<p>As a devoted backpack-boy, this bag was my first messenger bag. Every morning on the train I’d stare longingly at the sweet messenger bags and the ease with which fellow commuters accessed their possessions inside. Plus messenger bags look cool as hell and I’m a sap for good looking bags. It was a traditional “grass is greener” situation - I didn’t consider the trade-offs and that’s why I’m here now. Though there are a handful of benefits to messenger bags (as seen on the train). You can slide the bag around your body and sit comfortably without taking the bag off. Once sitting thusly, you can get whatever goodies you want from within. Messenger bags can also look slightly less childish or a bit more professional than backpacks - though the Monty doesn’t fit into that category thanks to its tech look. Basically they’re the same benefits as a purse just in a bigger package. After a few days of wear, the downsides started to present themselves as well. Body-hugging messenger bags tend to be poor for hard, flat objects like a laptop. (Do other people make a distinction between messenger bags (the cycling-friendly, body-hugging variety) and shoulder bags (the dangly variety)?). The flat surface of a laptop lying diagonally across your back also makes messenger bags a bit less comfortable than their two-strapped brethren. And if you have a heavy load (which I rarely do), the one-strap design can make your weak, tech-worker shoulder sore in a heartbeat. Once I added a six pack or two to my laptop on my walk home and my stuffed bag began to bounce on each step - it was strange and not something that’s likely to happen with one of my beloved backpacks. There are also the mount/dismount mechanics that involve sliding the strap over your head which can be more trouble than it’s worth if you’re wearing a loose hat (as I’m known to wear).</p>

<p>None of those are specific to the Monty - Advanced; certainly you’ve only read this far to hear about the cutting-edge Arkiv closure system and how the weatherproofing holds up in the real world. I did really like the components of the bag. The HT500 fabric looks very good - it has none of the synthetic-fabric shine common with nylon “pack cloth” and just enough of the feel of waxed canvas without being scratchable. I didn’t want an ostentatious fabric and this HT500 stuff sort of just blends into the background. Their proprietary closure/expansion system, “Arkiv”, is pretty neat. Mission Workshop’s Arkiv line of bags has rigid webbing rails onto which you can slide metal brackets attached to expansion modules or whatever you want to call them. But on the Monty - Advanced, the Arkiv rails and brackets are simply used to secure the main flap by sliding brackets on elastic straps over short rails on the flap of the bag. Since those short rails have to be rigid, they get in the way when closing the bag as a roll-top (the flap you’re rolling is partially rigid!). But it still works and looks good either way. The straps also get in the way when accessing the outer pockets though. When the bag’s closed with the flap unrolled, the flap covers up the external pockets so you have to unlatch at least one side of the main compartment to get your book out. It velcros closed when rolled down, so the Arkiv brackets then slide onto additional rails on the external pocket flap which you have to undo if you want to get into those pockets later. The external pockets also share a flap covering so I spent a lot of time bending it back to open one of the two pockets - a lot of the access to these pockets feels like an all-or-nothing effort where you either open the whole frickin bag or you just leave everything closed and stare mindlessly into your phone that’s always available in your jeans pocket. The Arkiv buckles do look about a hundred times better than the traditional snap-fit buckles on every other bag. It makes the bag look like it was constructed solidly. The construction quality definitely feels like a real “American-Made 9 out of 10”. On the other hand, there’s no internal organization in the bag. My laptop was free to slide around, twist diagonally and mess up my look. I really like separation between my precious work laptop and the other garbage I have in my bag (like soup).</p>

<p>The Monty - Advanced is a good bag. But it is for someone other than me. I will stick to my backpacks and let folks who have softer loads slide into this delightful bag. Maybe I’ll use it as a weekender when all I need to carry is a couple shirts, underwear, and a kindle; it’s just not ideal for laptop carriage. It might be nice for someone who carries a lot of “documents” or “folios” or maybe even shirts - who doesn’t need internal organization or is bringing their own. It is priced appropriately given the build quality and my hope that things not being “cheap” means that staff are paid well (it seems that Mission Workshop has about 20 workers). That is important to me in an industry that has so often taken advantage of its workforce - both in the less-skilled factory jobs and the high-profile fashion and design world. Overall 8 out of 10: recommended to people not carrying laptops.</p>
