	<p>big ups to John Anderson (lampwins) for having the curious mind and php know-how to crush this challenge in a matter of minutes – I was just along for the ride really</p>

<p>this challenge came from ringzer0team.com’s set of web challenges. we have been running through them with the cyber security club for the past few weeks for an upcoming web pen-testing engagement (maybe you’ll be able to read about it here later ;) ).</p>

<p>the scenario was that you’re resetting the password to the admin console of a website (the challenge lives here). they provide the source code (php) for the password resetting mechanism. it can be summed up thusly: use the current time to seed a PRNG, grab a ‘random’ number between 1000000000000000 and 9999999999999999 to use as a password reset token. then the page will accept GETs with a url parameter k which is compared to the previously generated token. if they match then your new password is printed to the screen, otherwise you get nothing. there is also a 1hr expiration for each token.</p>

<p>the biggest hint for this challenge is that the current time is included in the page telling you that your password has been reset:</p>

<p>[spoilers follow]</p>

<p>and we know that that time is used to seen the PRNG. once we convert that to unix time (seconds since 1 Jan 1970, UTC) we have the seed and can replicate the line</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"> <span class="err"> </span><span class="nv">$token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">rand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000000000000000</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">9999999999999999</span><span class="p">);</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>bonus: php one liner (once you have the timestamp):</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">php <span class="nt">-r</span> <span class="s2">"srand(1447631726); echo rand(1000000000000000,9999999999999999);"</span> </code></pre></figure>
