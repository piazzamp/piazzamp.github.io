	<p>In my earlier post, I said I wanted to set up my spring project (a little scheduling web app) only using infrastructure that is free-of-charge. After spending a while trolling the web looking for the cheapest hosted database, I could not find any for less than $10 per month. Most of the popular cloud service providers offer some weird, proprietary “nosql” “database” that’s usually a variant of a key-value store: Amazon has Dynamo, Google  has ‘Cloud Datastore’ (creative naming, as always), and I bet Heroku has a similar thing (their free-tier relational database is limited to like 10k rows or 5mb lol).Alas, my solution, I think, will be to set install mysql-server on the $5/month Digital Ocean box that I keep as a playground (the only things running on this box are my hacker news scraper on a cron job and sshd). It’s a bit of a bummer since I’ll have to maintain the database myself. I am terrified of being #online and will have to lookup how to enable key-based authentication on 32-bit mysql and set up harsh firewall rules, etc, etc.But, where will the app itself run? I am leaning towards Google App Engine - I used it for my senior project in school so I know know the basics of setting up a new project. More importantly, they have pretty generous ‘always-free’ usage limit: 28 compute-hours per day. They also give you 100 emails per day which should totally cover the amount of notifications I plan to have the service generate.My other goal was to avoid charging “avoid charging money for the majority of users”. I plan to offer it on a pay-what-you-want model - it seems that a lot of, uh, podcasts and #content #creators get money like that. I like the patreon model that’s like a kickstarter for things that are real; you can set up tiers of ‘rewards’. I’ll have to play that bit by ear though.</p>
