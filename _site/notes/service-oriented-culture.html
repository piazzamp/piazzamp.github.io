<p>I recently took on a second job as a host at a small new restaurant. I wanted in on this place, Juliet, because I love food and doing this on weekends could help me get familiar with the food &amp; bev scene in Charleston. After two weeks on the job I realized that I’m also just into the idea of customer service; the return on investment for things as easy as remembering someone’s name is insane. When expectations are basic, it’s not difficult to exceed patron’s expectations. Well, sure, smiles and customer satisfaction pay off immediately but repeat business pays off in the traditional sense over time.	To be sure, you have to remain genuine throughout any customer interactions. Don’t lie to make things seem more personalized – don’t say you’re going out of your way for this particular patron when you would’ve done it for anyone. Instead, use good old fashioned spin to phrase things that may be unsavory as though they may be in the customer’s interest. Be prepared with alternatives as well: “I can’t offer you tier two, but we’ll give you tier one for no extra charge” or whatever the circumstances allow for.	Being flexible goes miles as well. It piggybacks on being prepared with satisfactory alternatives. Doing something simple may seem like a big effort to your clients. When I worked at J. Crew in high school a nice woman asked me when we would get a particular set of shorts back in stock – we had no idea, so I offered to jot down her number and alert her when a new shipment came in. She was elated and it only cost me one sticky note and, later, a 45 second phone call. Don’t refuse to help someone out because it’s outside of standard practice. Be flexible and come up with a reasonable alternative that will work for you and them. Flexibility also applies to the words you use in these interactions – try not to make things sound like dead ends when there are valuable alternatives within arm’s reach.	Satisfying customers is as easy as seeming human: using full sentences, putting in what would be a normal amount of effort in any other interpersonal interaction, making other folks happy, etc. It makes no sense to me that standards for communication drop in contexts of sales – it’s reasonable for consumers to be wary of salespeople, but that’s unnecessary if everyone stopped trying to take advantage of each other. When being flexible and offering alternatives to your customers, don’t use it as an opportunity to upsell; be a rock of trust for the consumer. Consumers should trust the folks closer to the product, service, menu, etc, but the tendency for those more familiar with the goods to take advantage of their knowledge in order to extract more ‘value’ from the customer forces consumers to stay on guard. Providing good customer service is a win-win: the customer has the best possible experience, making the most of what you have to offer plus they feel comfortable and may be more likely to return in the future. If you go for the short-term win by upselling, putting your reputation on the line, you may lose the opportunity to make sales later. I think it’s a pretty clear embodiment of karma, eh?	I’m thinking about this because last night DJ and I went to Fig for dinner. Juliet’s closed on Mondays so we had the evening off. The experience was extremely smooth – DJ and I sat in awe. Every person we interacted with knew every detail of the menu. They were all exceptionally personable and offered detailed, trustworthy recommendations. There was a clear symbiosis wherein the staff’s commitment and passion for the menu, experience, and service meshed with DJ and I’s fascination with food &amp; wine, commitment to service, and familiarity with the scene. Imagine being a waiter and serving folks who don’t give a hoot about what you’re doing, the experience you’re trying to cultivate; imagine being an eater who’s committed to learning about food and service and facing a stiff or robotic waiter. The more interest people show for each other’s passion areas, the more satisfying these interactions can be.</p>
