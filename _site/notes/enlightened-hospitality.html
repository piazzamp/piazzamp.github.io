	<p>It’s a bit odd that I wrote my last post (Service Oriented Culture) just before starting Danny Meyer’s fantastic Setting the Table. There are numerous overlapping concepts between my little post and Meyer’s book - about treating people right and trying not to be an asshole. But one thing Danny hits on the head that I failed to mention is that the team comes first in the pyramid-of-needs that makes up his set of “enlightened hospitality” practices. The premier example he gives is banning smoking in Union Square Cafe in an attempt to protect his team from facing the ill effects of smoke exposure. I’ve seen this commitment to protecting the team in my brother when he sticks up for the numerous young women on staff when disrespectful men come out to harass. But I should also note that it is imperative to be hospitable to your coworkers. Why bother helping out your paying customers if you won’t give your cube-mate or back-waiter a sincere hello? You all have to work towards some common goal, you are in no way competing with one another. If you are trying to find a counter example realize that both you and your internal competitor will both be unemployed if the company isn’t successful. Your company’s success, ironically, also depends on this hospitality. Your client success manager shouldn’t have to tell you that the request they’re making is being passed down from some high-profile client - you should trust that client representative to pass down to you the most important of requests while protecting you from inane bullshit.tl;dr: continue to be nice to folks both inside and outside of your perceived team.</p>
