To be sure, you have to remain genuine throughout any customer interactions. Don’t lie to make things seem more personalized – don’t say you’re going out of your way for this particular patron when you would’ve done it for anyone. Instead, use good old fashioned spin to phrase things that may be unsavory as though they may be in the customer’s interest.

She was elated and it only cost me one sticky note and, later, a 45 second phone call. Don’t refuse to help someone out because it’s outside of standard practice. Be flexible and come up with a reasonable alternative that will work for you and them. Flexibility also applies to the words you use in these interactions – try not to make things sound like dead ends when there are valuable alternatives within arm’s reach.	Satisfying customers is as easy as seeming human: using full sentences, putting in what would be a normal amount of effort in any other interpersonal interaction, making other folks happy, etc. It makes no sense to me that standards for communication drop in contexts of sales – it’s reasonable for consumers to be wary of salespeople, but that’s unnecessary if everyone stopped trying to take advantage of each other. When being flexible and offering alternatives to your customers, don’t use it as an opportunity to upsell; be a rock of trust for the consumer. Consumers should trust the folks closer to the product, service, menu, etc, but the tendency for those more familiar with the goods to take advantage of their knowledge in order to extract more ‘value’ from the customer forces consumers to stay on guard. Providing good customer service is a win-win: the customer has the best possible experience, making the most of what you have to offer plus they feel comfortable and may be more likely to return in the future. If you go for the short-term win by upselling, putting your reputation on the line, you may lose the opportunity to make sales later. I think it’s a pretty clear embodiment of karma, eh?

Most of the popular cloud service providers offer some weird, proprietary “nosql” “database” that’s usually a variant of a key-value store: Amazon has Dynamo, Google  has ‘Cloud Datastore’ (creative naming, as always), and I bet Heroku has a similar thing (their free-tier relational database is limited to like 10k rows or 5mb lol).Alas, my solution, I think, will be to set install mysql-server on the $5/month Digital Ocean box that I keep as a playground (the only things running on this box are my hacker news scraper on a cron job and sshd). It’s a bit of a bummer since I’ll have to maintain the database myself. I am terrified of being #online and will have to lookup how to enable key-based authentication on 32-bit mysql and set up harsh firewall rules, etc, etc.But, where will the app itself run?

In my dive through stackoverflow and the mailing lists, I came across a pretty funny quip: Accipiter Nisus said “Whether or not assigning a new value to a variable is considered complex logic might be up for discussion.” And, of course, I sat at my desk laughing at the dystopian hellscape through which we each wade every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t entirely agree with the idea but, in this context, it’s right. I was trying to solve the wrong problem. Or the right problem in a sub-optimal way due to a misunderstanding of the tools I had at my disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I was trying to solve was a pretty straightforward web programming task - after a ‘delete’ action, remove an element (and its children) from the page. I already had an AJAX endpoint to handle the delete request and I wanted to add some client-side stuff to handle the clicks. My naive javascript skills told me to add unique IDs to each element that users could click (so I could getElementById later). That’s when I started trying to add some sort of accumulator to the template (, etc) which is not possible in Go’s templating engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution was to set the IDs of those interactive elements via javascript after the page loaded. It is pretty bad. I worked through some of a javascript tutorial like 3 days after I wrote this shitty code and now I think I know a more idiomatic way to do it: using document.querySelecorAll to grab all of the interactive things I wanted to work with. Then add an event listener on the appropriate child element (delete button) that makes the AJAX request and removes the outer element on success. This approach is somewhat limited by scoping issues, for example, if you had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;”deletable”&quot;&gt;
Matt &lt;button type=&quot;”button”&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;div&gt;


The click listener on the button should not remove this, but it could remove this.parentNode or the handler could be bound to the div element.addEventListener(“click”, deleteHandler.bind(outerDiv));

Making use of javascript’s this keyword and iterating across the nodelist returned by querySelectorAll are thousands of times better than trying to cajole a template to do something it wasn’t designed to do.

The moral of the story is that you should learn javascript.

tl;dr: if you’re having trouble doing seemingly simple things in your html templates, you’re probably approaching the problem incorrectly.

However, in the real world, there are seemingly simple scheduling tasks that human people engage in (either via manual arrangement or with the help of #software). The specific, human example I’m thinking of is scheduling part-time employees in a food &amp;amp; bev environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother, DJ, is helping open a few restaurants while managing a coffee shop. I have often seen him come home, open up google calendar, and begin to drag and drop 4, 6, and 8 hour blocks while calculating, in his head, which roles (dishwasher, barista, etc) need to be filled when, who can fill them, and who has requested time off. Of course, being an annoying software boy, I made fun of him for not using some product that could take in the resource pool, constraints, and desired staffing and output a decent schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out there are 2 SaaS products that aim to solve this problem and many full-blown HR systems that allow admins to schedule staff. These 2 standalone options are extrememly overpriced (and probably include features that are only used by a small minority of organizations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I Work is a beautiful product that has iOS and Android apps ready to download. It’s about $1 per user. They have a hard-to-find free tier that is significantly limited (&amp;lt; 6 users, no hallmark features, etc). It seemed like an OK choice for a very-small place. But! It only allows schedules to be planned 2 weeks ahead of time (in the free version only, I think).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schedulefly is not as sleek as When I Work, but it is at least as powerful (plus you can schedule arbitrarily far into the future as far as I can tell). But it rather expensive - with the cheapest plan starting at $30 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a simple-to-use scheduling web app exclusively using free cloud services. I want to avoid charging money for the majority of users. Sure, it’d be fun to make some money with this, but I think that’s where our friends at Schedulefly went wrong. If I can use free-tier AWS/GCE resources, then the only ‘cost’ of running it will be my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimum requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;employees have skills that correlate with roles they can play for a shift of work (running the register, busboy, etc)
employees can describe their availabilty and a maximum number of hours they’re willing to work per week
admins (managers?) can describe which skills each employee has
admins describe how many of each role they want at any time during a day
admins can reassign shifts after the system has assigned them
Table stakes for a real product:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;admin-approved shift swaps
notifications of shift changes
templates for typical week schedules
multiple restaurant management (it can probably be more general than restaurants, pretty much any place with multiple parttime employees like retail storefronts and so on)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In the world of computer science, there are many difficult problems under the ‘scheduling’ umbrella - interrupts, multi-threading, locks, and so on.

I’ve found that what I aimed to learn in each experience remained fairly consistent, while my employers’ expectations varied wildly. I think of internships as long-term interviews during which the intern should strive to provide value to their employer. It’s also a great opportunity for a young person without a tight grasp on the industrial landscape to get a feel for different work environments before committing to a permanent position. At the same time, employers should dance along with their interns - pushing them to figure out how much value they could bring to the organization in a full-time setting.Gaining work experience before graduation is one of the most useful, rewarding pursuits a young person can follow. Students have the opportunity to apply what they’re learning in the classroom which helps with both information retention in the classroom and job performance at the office. At the same time, there’s a whole bunch of stuff going on out in the wild that is nowhere on the syllabus; picking up these industry practices is significantly easier in the workplace than in a side project. Internships are possibly the only way to slowly mold your lifestyle from the classroom to the office with limited shock. And, oftentimes, STEM internships offer wages better than standard entry-level part-time jobs. It’s hard to speak for other industries, but no one should be taking unpaid computer science internships in 2017. There are often clear-cut laws regarding how and when internships can be unpaid; interns are usually forbidden from doing work and relegated to ‘shadowing’ or whatever when they’re unpaid. If you’re considering taking an unpaid internship please log on to google.com and search for your local labor laws.	Asking too much of your interns is myopic and greedy. It is very simple: Asking two part-time interns to build your product from the ground up with no technical oversight is exploitative. Sure, it might feel cheap in the short term, but as soon as you scale up and bring in experienced developers to maintain the likely repulsive codebase it will become an obvious sore. Unrestrained youths have a lot of ideas, but let me assure you that only a small fraction of those should be realized and made available to the general public.	I have, however, had the pleasure of re-building a product from the ground up as an intern. The experience was beneficial to me since there was adequate technical oversight and it was at an established company with developed infrastructure. And the company benefited by getting a decent proof-of-concept out of it. The expectations were set along the lines of ‘do you best’ (as you might for an interview) but there was a plan B were I incapable of delivering a satisfactory rewrite. It was a low-risk scenario for my employer while a massive opportunity for myself.	On the other end of the spectrum is when nothing is expected. While less stressful for the intern, setups with non-existent expectations do little to help either party. The intern has to press for tasks and access to relevant systems. And the employer learns little about the skills of the person they’re considering. When I was in a situation like this I felt sort of disrespected - I thought I was being hired for my skills but it turned out that I was more like a corporate requirement that had to be filled. Please don’t hire interns (or full-time employees for that matter) if you have nothing for them to do.	Aside from opportunity cost, Interns usually don’t have much at risk during less-than-ideal internships since they are often at-will or within a set timeframe (the duration of summer break, for example). The main thing to keep in mind (especially for internships that have no set end date) is that internships are a two-party dance in which you must respect your partner while trying to maximize their use to you. If you meet an ambitious entrepreneur who wants you to be a pivotal part of their team (the Woz to their Jobs, if you will), make sure you are adequately compensated - getting in on the ground floor of a budding startup can seem like (and be) a great opportunity, but that only holds true so long as you aren’t overworked and underpaid. Young people are especially easy to take advantage of since they have a limited amount of experience and internships seem like the best low-risk places to gain these sorts of experiences. Engineers must vigilantly screen anyone we work for to protect ourselves from the overzealous and under-technical.	Some of my most rewarding experiences came from part-time internships throughout the school year - it allowed for a smoothing of the flow of intern-appropriate tasks. As a youth I often imagined that internships were only summer things, but the work I did during the school-year ended up being critical to both my understanding of the coursework as well as my performance in industry. I think being ‘always on’ was a fantastic way to immerse myself in the software engineering field. Part-time positions may also be less work for the employers since they’ll only have to deal with (and pay) and intern 10-25 hours per week.	Thanks go out to the folks who hired me while I was in school - I’ll be sure to follow your example if I’m ever in a position to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="internships" /><category term="computer science" /><summary type="html">(four great interns in a decommissioned datacenter)While I was in school, I had the formative privilege of interning with a range of different organizations.

The expectations were set along the lines of ‘do you best’ (as you might for an interview) but there was a plan B were I incapable of delivering a satisfactory rewrite. It was a low-risk scenario for my employer while a massive opportunity for myself. On the other end of the spectrum is when nothing is expected. While less stressful for the intern, setups with non-existent expectations do little to help either party. The intern has to press for tasks and access to relevant systems. And the employer learns little about the skills of the person they’re considering. When I was in a situation like this I felt sort of disrespected - I thought I was being hired for my skills but it turned out that I was more like a corporate requirement that had to be filled. Please don’t hire interns (or full-time employees for that matter) if you have nothing for them to do. Aside from opportunity cost, Interns usually don’t have much at risk during less-than-ideal internships since they are often at-will or within a set timeframe (the duration of summer break, for example). The main thing to keep in mind (especially for internships that have no set end date) is that internships are a two-party dance in which you must respect your partner while trying to maximize their use to you. If you meet an ambitious entrepreneur who wants you to be a pivotal part of their team (the Woz to their Jobs, if you will), make sure you are adequately compensated - getting in on the ground floor of a budding startup can seem like (and be) a great opportunity, but that only holds true so long as you aren’t overworked and underpaid. Young people are especially easy to take advantage of since they have a limited amount of experience and internships seem like the best low-risk places to gain these sorts of experiences. Engineers must vigilantly screen anyone we work for to protect ourselves from the overzealous and under-technical. Some of my most rewarding experiences came from part-time internships throughout the school year - it allowed for a smoothing of the flow of intern-appropriate tasks. As a youth I often imagined that internships were only summer things, but the work I did during the school-year ended up being critical to both my understanding of the coursework as well as my performance in industry. I think being ‘always on’ was a fantastic way to immerse myself in the software engineering field. Part-time positions may also be less work for the employers since they’ll only have to deal with (and pay) and intern 10-25 hours per week. Thanks go out to the folks who hired me while I was in school - I’ll be sure to follow your example if I’m ever in a position to do so.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Zero Values and JSON in Go</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/notes/zero-values-and-json-in-go" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Zero Values and JSON in Go" /><published>2016-02-20T19:41:58-06:00</published><updated>2016-02-20T19:41:58-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/notes/zero-values-and-json-in-go</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/notes/zero-values-and-json-in-go">&lt;p&gt;Go is great, I think that is apparent. If you have talked to me about software development at all in the past 5 months then you have certainly heard me talk about Go and how pleasing I find it to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are great, baked-in features, like documentation, testing, and (obviously) JSON encoding &amp;amp; decoding of native types. It’s very simple to enable - any exported attribute (a field marked public, if you’re java-kin) of a struct can be encoded by the encoding/json package and will give you the obvious result where all struct elements have identical JSON field names. You have the option to override this default behavior and rename the fields or omit them entirely if they’re empty. So if your user has no middleName then the JSON version of that person will just not have a middleName field. Sound strightforward?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does encoding/json determine which fields to omit? I can’t say that I have read through their implementation, but it is safe to say that the package omits any field that has the zero-value for its type. That is a 0-length string, the int 0, float 0.0, or false. This works sometimes. If you want to pass back a false or a 0, your JSON representation will simply not have the fields you have set to those values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: make sure there is no case where you want to send a zero-value via JSON in a field marked omitempty&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="golang" /><category term="json" /><summary type="html">Go is great, I think that is apparent.

&lt;p&gt;this challenge came from ringzer0team.com’s set of web challenges. we have been running through them with the cyber security club for the past few weeks for an upcoming web pen-testing engagement (maybe you’ll be able to read about it here later ;) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the scenario was that you’re resetting the password to the admin console of a website (the challenge lives here). they provide the source code (php) for the password resetting mechanism. it can be summed up thusly: use the current time to seed a PRNG, grab a ‘random’ number between 1000000000000000 and 9999999999999999 to use as a password reset token. then the page will accept GETs with a url parameter k which is compared to the previously generated token. if they match then your new password is printed to the screen, otherwise you get nothing. there is also a 1hr expiration for each token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the biggest hint for this challenge is that the current time is included in the page telling you that your password has been reset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[spoilers follow]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and we know that that time is used to seen the PRNG. once we convert that to unix time (seconds since 1 Jan 1970, UTC) we have the seed and can replicate the line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1000000000000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;9999999999999999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bonus: php one liner (once you have the timestamp):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;keep calm and ctf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the challenge presented us with an image and told us it was special. steganography was likely a force at play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;above is the way I actually solved this one (with david). highlighted, you can see the flag. this solution was inspired by the photo of yoshi in fuzyll’s recon challenge. both of these images contained stegonagraphic data inside of an image. for yoshi, I tried to view the source to look for html comments or some other easy hint like that, but instead I saw this steganographic stuff. nice nice.
an easier (and more 1337 way to find this) is to combine xxd and vim into a mythical hexeditor. thanks to my coworker, king, for showing me this recently.
basically, open img.jpg with vim and type :%!xxd which, if I am interpreting it correctly, runs xxd on the file (aka %) and writes the results back into the buffer. see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then just slam :q! to exit without saving the hexdump. or you could, ya’‘know, just hexdump outside of vim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;flash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the challenge statment for this one was: We were able to grab an image of a harddrive. Find out what’’s on it. tough. I downloaded the file and ran strings on it to see if there was anything especially juicy. the last printable string in the image turned out to be the flag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;obviously this is supposed to represent some binary data. I googled ’binary to ascii’ and pasted in the string. which is kind of funny since it’s ascii to ascii, really (or, like, ascii to unicode or something). episode 1.1, easy as pie.&lt;/p&gt;

me, elaina, sarah, and callum swarmed to the file for some quick frequency analysis. such a short piece of ciphertext could only get us so far. sarah had taken some sort of cryptology course in estonia so she told us to examine the frequencies of n-grams. that also gave us some strong candidate translations. but what ended up being the key, was to simply look at the ciphertext and figure out how it could fit into the english language. we focused on EOY and TOY – EOY has to be a word that can start a sentence or phrase and its last two letters must make sense as the last two letters of another 3-letter word. the same tactic was applied to XF (word 2) and YF (word 8). we attempted to uncover the substitution alphabet one or two characters at a time, then translate the ciphertext with each character in the candidate substitution alphabet lowercased so that we would be able to more easily see which character we still had to uncover. the apostrophes helped a lot – VH’‘JH was likely we’‘re or we’‘ve and each of the single characters following an apostrophe was likely a t, s, or maybe even a d. after applying some of these assumptions, more patterns became apparent and some partially decrypted words had an obvious plaintext value that lead to the discovery of more of the substitution alphabet. here’s a glamour shot of the finale to this solve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this one was solved by ethan.
if you aren’t familiar with base64 encoding, I googled it for you. but essentially, it’s a way to encode binary data to printable ascii characters. it’s used in http basic authentication. you can put binary data in-line in an html file with this sort of encoding.
immeiately I try base64 -D eps1.9_zer0-day_b7604a922c8feef666a957933751a074.avi only to see Invalid character in input stream. I determined that it was the backslash () that was invalid. so I removed them all and everything came out screwey when I went to decode it again. since each character represents 5 bits, incorrectly removing a single character from base64 encoded data will misalign the following bits. anyway, ethan later told us that the \ I was removing should have been \n – the standard newline escape sequence. thus: sed ‘’s/\n//g’’ eps1.9_zer0-day_b7604a922c8feef666a957933751a074.avi | base64 -D -. a few things are going on in this command. first the sed command contains two backslashes \ to escape a single backslash so that the pattern matches the \n in the input string. then there are two forward slashes // which is normally where we would put the string to replace \n with, but we’re just replacing it with nothing. then the - at the very end, this is to represent stdin ie base64 will decode whatever comes into stdin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;very cool. 150 points in the bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;notesy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;next is a 100-point challenge that unfortunately eschews the Mr Robot theme. the challenge is down now so I missed my opportunity to take a gnarly screen grab (jk it was just a input textbox on a page). anything you put in this textbox would be ‘encrypted’ by what seemd to be yet another substitution cipher. competitors in the #isislab irc channel were flipping out about this one. I admit to having similar frustrations as them – there seemed to be little direction to the challenge. it was easy to figure out what was going on but not to figure out what the flag should be. later on the CSAW team put up some good hints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;these hints came, word for word, from the irc channel. anyway they lead me to the solution – the substitution alphabet which can simply be recovered by entering in the normal alphabet into the encrytor: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz if you’re not familiar. once you know how the characters are rearranged you have broken the cryptosystem and can go back-n-forth between plaintext and ciphertext as you please.
ps – the youtube link in hint no. 2 goes to nic cage teaches the alphabet since you just had to enter the abc’s to solve the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="csaw" /><category term="ctf" /><category term="hacking" /><summary type="html">all of the 50-point crypto challenges this year were based on Mr Robot episodes – the ciphertext files were named after episodes while all the flags were quotes from that episode. neat.</summary></entry></feed>
